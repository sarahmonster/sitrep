# SITREP
A custom project status page for Github, originally designed for [a talk I gave at DotYork](http://triggersandsparks.com/talks/github).

When using Github for project management, sometimes it's tricky to get a sense of the project as a whole. This is an attempt to show, in a visual way, where a project is currently at: what's been done, what needs attention, and what's coming next. Particularly useful when working with non-technical clients who may not be super accustomed to Github's interface!
